Day 1 is about getting comfortable with Python. No pressure, no complexity.

# What is Python?

Python is a high‑level programming language known for:

*Simple syntax

*Readable code

*Fast scripting

*Strong standard library

Python is widely used because it lets you focus on logic, not syntax noise.

# How Python Scripts Work

1.Python code is written in .py files

2.Scripts are executed top to bottom

3.Python is case‑sensitive

4.Indentation matters (instead of {})

Example:
```python
    print("Hello, World!")
```
## Variables
Variables store data.
```python
username = "Zohaib"
age = 23
```
Python decides the data type automatically.

## Input and Output
```pytho
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)
```
input() always returns a string
Use print() to display output

## Basic Data Types
### String
```pytho
text = "Hello"
```
### Integer
```python
number = 10
```
### List
```python
ports = [22, 80, 443]
```
### Dictionary
```python
ip_failures = {
"192.168.1.1": 3,
"192.168.1.2": 5
}
```
