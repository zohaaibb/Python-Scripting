# Python-Scripting
This is the Python Scripting Repository, which contains guide to Python Scripting from Scratch to Intermediate Level

Welcome to Python Scripting, a repository created to learn Python from absolute zero, with a strong focus on fundamentals, clarity, and real scripting habits.

This repository is intentionally not tool‑focused (red team / blue team). Instead, it builds core scripting skills that can later be applied to any domain: cybersecurity, automation, data processing, DevOps, or general software work.

# Learning Philosophy

->Learn from scratch, no assumptions

->Understand why code works, not just how

->Prefer clean, readable scripts over clever tricks

->Build scripts the way they are used in the real world

# What You’ll Learn Here

->Python basics (variables, data types, input/output)

->Control flow (loops, conditions)

->Functions and modular code

->Dictionaries and file handling

->Command‑line arguments

->Error handling

->Writing scripts that don’t crash

This repository will grow day by day, with each concept building on the previous one.
